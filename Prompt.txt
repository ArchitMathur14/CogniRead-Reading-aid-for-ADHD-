PROMPT_1-CHATGPT(GPT-5.2)

Role: You are an expert Full-Stack Developer specializing in cognitive science and speed-reading technologies.
Task: Write the complete, single-file source code (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript) for a Speed Reading Web Application inspired by "Swift Read" and "Spritz".
Core Functionality:
RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation) Engine:
Display words one by one in a fixed container.
Red Focal Point: The "Optimal Recognition Point" (ORP) of the word must be highlighted in red and perfectly centered in the display box to minimize eye movement.
Adjustable WPM: Allow the user to set Words Per Minute (Range: 100 to 1000 WPM).
Controls: Play, Pause, Reset buttons.
Input Methods:
A text area for users to paste their own text.
A "Read" button that parses the text and initializes the RSVP reader.
UI/UX Requirements:
Modern, Minimalist Design: Use a dark mode interface by default (dark gray background, light text).
Typography: Use a monospaced font or a clean sans-serif font for the reader display.
Visual Guide: The reader box should have clear top and bottom borders to guide the eye.
Algorithm Logic for ORP (Optimal Recognition Point):
For each word, calculate the center character.
If the word length is 1-3, center on the 2nd character.
If 4-7, center on the 3rd.
If 8+, center on the 4th.
Constraint: Ensure the red character is always geographically fixed in the center of the div so the user's eye never moves left or right.
Technical Constraints:
Use strictly a single HTML file containing <style> for CSS and <script> for JS.
Do not require external libraries (no React/Vue/jQuery CDN links) to ensure it runs offline.
Handle basic punctuation delays: Add a slight extra delay (e.g., +100ms) when a word ends in a period or comma to improve comprehension.  create an app.py file.

EDITS   Kindly update a few things.  the output text does not come in the center but on a righter side. 
I need you to make the screen where the output words occur bigger, and the input box below. 
The output box should be above and bigger and the text in center, but the input box should be of the same size it is now but below. 
2)Remove the read button, just keep play pause and reset button

ERRORS : unterminated triple-quoted string literal , it stops after 'a' appeared in the input text. its stilll not in the center of the output box
